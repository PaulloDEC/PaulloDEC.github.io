# High Priority

> Level viewer is still missing tons of functionality
	> Would love to do something about that brown grid pattern - not sure where it comes from, but needs to be toggleable.
	> Certain metaframes can't do what I want, like combining the empty shell for the blue prize bubbles with the inner sparkles. Maybe that can be done the same way as overlaying the thing inside crates over the crate image?

# Medium Priority

> Tons of files in the MISC category that I need to work out what they are and consider viewers for them
> Actor viewer has been improved but I'd still like to rethink the whole thing. There's gotta be a better way to view sprites.
	> Would love to have a view that shows every frame for every actor in a row
	> Need to disable the tooltips when in Raw view, doesn't have any utility there
	> Some metaframes are too big for their cells and the art is getting squashed and blurry - Super Force Field and Force Field for example
> AUDIOHED and AUDIOT show the same sounds - we don't need both entries in the asset list
> Adjust tooltip function for actors so that "Type" is shown

# Low Priority

> Would be nice to fix the issue where playing an adlib or pc speaker sound would pause music rather than stop it
> The zoom factor currently resets when switching to a new asset. This makes sense for levels, but not so much for fullscreen images or tilesets
> LCR.MNI actually *is* an image and not really a palette (it's the anti-piracy screen IIRC) - need to sort that out
