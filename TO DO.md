# GENERAL UI AND FUNCTION

# LEVEL VIEWER

> Would love to do something about that brown grid pattern - not sure where it comes from, but needs to be toggleable.
> Certain metaframes can't do what I want, like combining the empty shell for the blue prize bubbles with the inner sparkles. Maybe that can be done the same way as overlaying the thing inside crates over the crate image?

# MISC CATEGORY

> Tons of files that I need to work out what they are and consider viewers for them

# ACTOR VIEWER

> Need to disable the tooltips when in Raw view, doesn't have any utility there
> The detail view on an actor could be styled better

# SFX - ADLIB/PC VIEWER

> Would be nice to fix the issue where playing an adlib or pc speaker sound would pause music rather than stop it

# BACKGROUND VIEWER

> The zoom factor currently resets when switching to a new asset within a category, like backgrounds or tilesets. This makes sense for levels, but not so much for fullscreen images or tilesets

# PALETTE VIEWER

> LCR.MNI actually *is* an image and not really a palette (it's the anti-piracy screen IIRC) - need to sort that out
